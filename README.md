Week 9 challenge :3 
Lowkey bummed I have to write out a READ ME, but here is the code I used and my processes.
I had the pleasure of talking with Luke and Ian on AskBCS, they were able to help me understand the errors in my code, as well as how to import files meant for data.

When importing csv files into tables, if you import 1.csv into table 1, and then right click on table 2, the file location will name 1.csv, which is APPARENTLY NORMAL.
You then change the file location to 2.csv and click done, and it sets 2.csv to table 2, it doesn't change anything to table 1.

I also had a couple typos that caused errors but those were easy :3
